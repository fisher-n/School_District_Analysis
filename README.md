- The district summary was affected when removing the dishonest test scores on Thomas High School. Decreasing math scores from 83.41 to 83.35 and reading scores and increasing the reading scores from 83.84 to 83.89.
- The only change in school summary was unsignificant reduction in the passing precentages in math, reading and overall of the Thomas High School only; everything else is the same.
- When the 9th-grade scores from THS are removed, we see a percent passing rate that is slightly lower. Without removing this data, Thomas High School students passed math at a rate of 93.27% and reading at 97.31%. With this filter, the passing rates are 97% for reading, and 93.19% for math.
- The preformance was worsened however its ranking remained the same.
- Math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type are the same in both cases.

## Summary
Changes to the outcome of school district analysis after the reading and math scores have been replaced are as follows:
- The overall passing precentage is unsiginificant reduction in the math and reading and overall.
- An unnoticable decrease in the passing precentages in math, reading and overall in 9th grade summary.
- A very small decrease in the passing precentages in math, reading and overall in charter school type in the school type summary.
- An unsignificant reduction in the passing precentages in math, reading and overall off the thomas high school only.
